  shouldn't be there if it isn't good

- fixed bug in MARC::XMLWriter that was outputting all control field tags as 00z
  (thanks Ross Singer)
- added :include_namespace option to MARC::XMLWriter::encode to include the
  marcxml namespace, which allows MARC::Record::to_xml to emit the namespace 
  for a single record.

v0.1.3  Tue Jan  2 12:56:36 EST 2007
- added ability to map a MARC record to the Dublin Core fields.  Calling
  to_dublin_core on a MARC::Record returns a hash that has Dublin Core fields
  as the hash keys.

v0.1.2  Thu Dec 21 18:46:01 EST 2007
- fixed MARC::Record::to_xml so that it actually is tested and works (thanks 
  Ross Singer)

- removed namespace declarations on record elements in favor of default 
  namespace on collection element
- added spaces around subfield code and delimeter in to_s
- fixed up relevant tests that were expecting old formatting

  was found on an element (exposed by namespace changes).

v0.0.7  Mon Jan  2 21:39:28 CST 2006
- MARC::XMLWriter added
- removed encode/decode methods in MARC::MARC21 into MARC::Writer and 
  MARC::Reader respectively. This required pushing MARC21 specific constants 
  out into MARC::Constants which is required as necessary.

  to MARC::Constants
- added MARC::XMLReader for reading MARX as XML
- added xml reading tests
- fixed indentation to be two spaces

  reading an extra character

  possibly faulty offsets when the user needs them.

v0.0.2  Mon Oct 17 17:42:57 CDT 2005
