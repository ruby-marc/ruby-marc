  # Like Reader ForgivingReader lets you read in a batch of MARC21 records
  # but it does not use record lengths and field byte offets found in the 
  # leader and directory. It is not unusual to run across MARC records
  # which have had their offsets calcualted wrong. In situations like this
  # the vanilla Reader may fail, and you can try to use ForgivingReader.
  
  # The one downside to this is that ForgivingReader will assume that the
  # order of the fields in the directory is the same as the order of fields
  # in the field data. Hopefully this will be the case, but it is not 
  # 100% guranteed which is why the normal behavior of Reader is encouraged.
