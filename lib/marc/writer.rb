module MARC

  # A class for writing MARC records as binary MARC (ISO 2709)
  #
  # == Too-long records
  #
  # The MARC binary format only allows records that are total 99999 bytes long,
  # due to size of a length field in the record.
  #
  # By default, the Writer will raise a MARC::Exception when encountering
  # in-memory records that are too long to be legally written out as ISO 2709
  # binary.

  # However, if you set `allow_oversized` to true, then the Writer will
  # write these records out anyway, filling in any binary length/offset slots
  # with all 0's, if they are not wide enough to hold the true value.
  # While these records are illegal, they can still be read back in using
  # the MARC::ForgivingReader, as well as other platform MARC readers
  # in tolerant mode.
  #
  # If you set `allow_oversized` to false on the Writer, a MARC::Exception
  # will be raised instead, if you try to write an oversized record.
  #
  #    writer = Writer.new(some_path)
  #    writer.allow_oversized = true
